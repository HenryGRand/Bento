### Customization

> All the code is using variables and is comented, It's easy to customize the project to your own, and this sections are the principal customizable elements in the Startpage:

#### Links and Icons
You can change the links (and the icons too) in the HTML Code:

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/MiguelRAvila/Bento/blob/master/assets/code1.png">
</p>

Change the link in the `href` property with the link you want. (The `target="blank"` makes the link to open a new tab with the link you choose). 
The Project uses [Feather icons](https://feathericons.com/) for the icons, and you can change them in the `data-feather=""` property with the name of the icon.

Once you have your Key you'll need to set yourlatitude and longitude, you can use: `https://www.latlong.net/` to get them. Once you have the data, you'll need to set them in the `weather.js` in the **js** folder. The code is 

> If you don't like the idea of having your API Key public, you can make the repo into a private one. You can still use the Github Pages service.

#### Greetings
You can put your name and change the greetings.

```js
var name = 'John Doe'; 
var lateTxt = 'Go to Sleep! ';
var morningTxt = 'Good morning! ';
var afterTxt = 'Good afternoon ';
var evenTxt = 'Good evening ';
```

It'll change in order of the hour.

#### Image Background

You can set your own background image with the variable `--imgbg` and set the route to the image you want It's disable by default. If you uncomment the variable, it has by default this image: 

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/MiguelRAvila/Bento/blob/master/assets/previewbg.png">
</p>

It has a black filter by default in `--imgcol`, and it'ts value is: `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.7)` and `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.7)` for the dark theme. You can change them and the opacity for a better experience with your image.
